# 📝 Handwritten Digit Recognition with Neural Networks

This project implements a neural network using TensorFlow and Keras to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## 📦 Description

The model is trained on the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/), which contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits (0–9). The goal is to classify digits based on pixel data using a deep learning approach.
